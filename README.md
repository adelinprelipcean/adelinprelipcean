👋 Hi, I’m Adelin. I am a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student at USV, focused on building robust software and understanding systems from the hardware up.

I prioritize deep learning from technical literature (e.g., Petzold, Stroustrup) over surface-level tutorials, building systems with a strong theoretical foundation.

💻 **Core Focus:**
• **Software Engineering:** Desktop apps with Python (CustomTkinter), concurrency & media processing.
• **Embedded Systems:** Developing autonomous robotics using ESP32 & Arduino.
• **Low-Level:** Exploring C++ architecture through emulation (CHIP-8).
• **AI Foundations:** Applied Machine Learning (Scikit-learn) with a goal to integrate AI into physical systems.

🚀 **Current Projects:**
• **Play.listed:** Open-source YouTube playlist downloader (Python/Multithreading).
• **ESP32 Smart Car:** Hardware/software robotics project.

🛠 **Tech Stack:**
Python • C/C++ • ESP32 • Git • SQL • Scikit-learn

Open to connecting with engineers and exploring internship opportunities.
